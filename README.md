# Quora_duplicate_questions

Trying to identify Quora question pairs which are duplicates. More information on that is present on [Quora](https://data.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs).
To solve this problem, I am trying to take help from the IEEE paper, [Sentence similarity based on semantic nets and corpus statistics](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1644735/).
